You'll need lame, mplayer and a python library called mutagen.

It should run wherever the requirements are met. I run it into a virtual 
machine running Slackware on my MacBook.

Run the sh script passing the name of a directory where it can find 
some m4a file in and it will decode to wav, encode to mp3 and copy some 
of the m4a metadata to the mp3 id3tag. Finally it will clean the dir 
from the intermediate wav files.

You can change the options passed to LAME from the bash script. Read the 
comments.

I don't support this set of scripts but I hope you'll find them useful. 
If you want to improve or fix stuff, http://github.com/alieb/m4atomp3 
fork, create an AUTHORS file, stick your name in, do your stuff, notify 
me with a pull request and that's it.
